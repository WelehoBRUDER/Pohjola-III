# Version 0.1.1 ~ 2023.3.12

## New features & additions
- Added target lock on mechanic to settings.
- Added "fight" command to the game.
- Added the "ranger" armor set. 
  * This armor set is a bit weaker than the "plate" armor set, but it has a chance to dodge attacks.
- Added some missing localization.
# Bug fixes
- Fixed being able to upgrade the first perk, despite it having no levels. 
  * This happened because the max level check was done after a requirement check  
  which the first perk passes by default.
- Fixed not being able to unequip armor.

# Version 0.1 ~ 2023.3.11
This is the first proper version of Pohjola III.  
The game is still in early development, so expect bugs and missing features.

## New features & additions
- Dungeons mechanics are mostly working.
  * The game currently has 1 dungeon.

### This version does not have any changes as there are no previous versions.
